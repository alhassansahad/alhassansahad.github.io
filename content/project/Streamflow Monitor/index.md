title: Stream Flow Monitor
summary: "A code for easily monitoring of streamflow data collected by USGS. All that is needed is the gage number and historical streamflow can be visualized. Streamflow is the amount of water flowing through a given point of water per unit time. It is a major hydrological variable that is measured in hydrologic modeling. streamflow gives a rough idea about the quantity of water resources in a given watershed"
