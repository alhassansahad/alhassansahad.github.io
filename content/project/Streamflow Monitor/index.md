title: Stream Flow Monitor
summary: "This project aims to simplify the process of monitoring streamflow data collected by USGS. By simply providing the gage number, users can easily visualize the historical streamflow information. Streamflow is a crucial hydrological variable used in hydrologic modeling, as it represents the amount of water flowing through a particular point per unit time. This program offers a convenient way to gain insight into the quantity of water resources within a given watershed by analyzing the streamflow data"
