I am PhD student at the Institute for Data Science and Informatics, University of Missouri-Columbia with specialization in Geoinformatics. My research interests focuses on Machine Learning and AI applications in Hydrology, Remote Sensing and Geospatial Data Analytics. Currently, I am a Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr.Timothy Haithcoat.

Earlier, I obtained my Masters Degree in Hydrogeology and GIS from Illinois State University. I worked on the using Using Machine Learning to predict water quality some watersheds in Illinois, I also worked on the use of Tracer test to assess the Transport and Fate of Nitrate in a Buffer Zone

I use open source geospatial tools for analyzing complex geospatial data to draw insight from them to solve problems related to water resources, environmental monitoring and health. I place great value on the replicability of research and data science projects. To achieve this, I prefer utilizing a programming approach rather than relying on point and click software for conducting such projects. As a result, I primarily analyze my data in a Python programming environment.I am currently working on using machine learning for nitrogen risk prediction in the state of Missouri.
